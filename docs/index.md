# RFviewJS - RNA Framework Structure Viewer

## Introduction

__[RFviewJS](https://github.com/dincarnato/RFviewJS)__ is a self-contained JavaScript library for rendering RNA secondary structures and consensus structures from Stockholm alignments. It supports, __all without any external dependencies__:

- automatic layout selection (Radiate vs. NAView)
- manual helix rotation, reactivity color mapping (SHAPE/DMS)
- base-pair and helix-level covariation annotations from R-scape
- CSS styling
- SVG export

Furthermore, thanks to the power of __[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)__, __RFview__ is also provided as a stand-alone app for Windows, Linux and Mac.

For support requests, please post your questions to: <https://github.com/dincarnato/RFviewJS/issues>

## Notes

The main plotting functions for the Radiate layout were ported from __[Yann Ponty's VARNA](https://github.com/yannponty/VARNA)__.

The NAView layout was ported from __[Ivo Hofacker's adaptation](https://github.com/ViennaRNA/RNAcode/blob/master/librna/naview.c)__ of [Bruccoleri & Heinrich](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2454712/) original algorithm, and adapted to enable helix rotation in a Radiate-like fashion.

Code auditing and bug fixing, as well as bundling of the JS into an Electron app was done with the crucial aid of __[ClaudeAI](https://claude.ai/)__.
